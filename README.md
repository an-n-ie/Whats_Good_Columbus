## Features

This project was done as full stack project which we used SQL, Express, Nodes and Javascripts.  

## Future enhancement

We are planning to add geo location for the post listed.  Also will be adding API that can look up events date and cancellation.  Further more, we will be spliting them into 3 different categorize that will make it easier for user to use and search for post with a new search box.
